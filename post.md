# Everything Is Music

We're going to teach our computers to sing using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), along with a little light physics and music theory.

Before we get started, take a few minutes to watch Icelandic musical tour de force [Bj√∂rk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj%C3%B6rk) dismantle her televesion:

TODO make sure this is actually the right clip

As she so succinctly and charmingly notes: "everything is music".  Let's extract some music from our computers - it's been sitting right there.

## Motivation

This post was inpsired by this `bash` one-liner:

```bash
cat /dev/urandom | hexdump -v -e '/1 "%u\n"' | awk '{ split("0,2,4,5,7,9,11,12",a,","); for (i = 0; i < 1; i+= 0.0001) printf("%08X\n", 100*sin(1382*exp((a[$1 % 8]/12)*log(2))*i)) }' | xxd -r -p | aplay -c 2 -f S32_LE -r 16000
```

Check out a blog post about how that line specifically works [here](https://blog.robertelder.org/bash-one-liner-compose-music/).  This post explores the same logic but in Rust.  If you're anything like me, though, you kinda glaze over when first looking at token-soup like that.  The fact that it's so succint, though, should tell you we're actually up against a relatively straightforward operation.  Here's a friendlier walktrhough that doesn't require a Linux administration background to understand:

1. Get a random stream of binary data
1. Convert binary to 8-bit integers (0-255)
1. Map integers to notes

## Implementation

### Random input data

// Get random number stream
// Map random data to u8 stream

### Mapping Bytes To Notes

This is the meat of the program - turning our numeric data into something we can hear.  To get from random numbers to sounds we can hear, we need to map each data point to an amplitude.  The relevant section of the `bash` again:

```bash
awk '{ split("0,2,4,5,7,9,11,12",a,","); for (i = 0; i < 1; i+= 0.0001) printf("%08X\n", 100*sin(1382*exp((a[$1 % 8]/12)*log(2))*i)) }'
```

No, just mashing your keyboard will likely not yield similar results.  I tried it myself so you don't have to.  Tools like `awk` are terse, but this is merely a `for` loop with some math in the body.

#### A Little Physics

A sound at a specific pitch is a consequence of that sound's frequency.  You may know that sound travels as a "wave":

TODO Sound Graph



#### A Little Music Theory

Sound is a continuous spectrum of frequency, but when we make music deliberatly we tend to use scales to pick which frequency to use.  To start, though, we need some sort of standard, and the world has settled on [440hz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A440_(pitch_standard)) (or the "Stuttgart Pitch"), which is the A above Middle C.  If you're a musicion, you may own a tuner that marks 440 specifically.  This pitch is used for calibrating musical instruments and tuning a group, and we'll use it as a baseline constant for calculating frequencies.

A [scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(music)) is a series of notes (frequencies).  The smallest of these is called a [semitone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone), or minor second.  A major scale, also known as [Ionian mode](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(music)), falls into a category called [diatonic scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatonic_scale), where the full range consists of five whole steps, which is two semitones or a [major second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_second) and two half steps (semitones):

```txt
whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half
```

TODO embed sound


There are a few variations of minor scale, but for this application I'll define the [natural minor scale](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale#Natural_minor_scale) (a.k.k Aeolian mode):

```txt
whole, half, whole, whole, half, whole, whole
```

TODO embed sound

Note that this scale is still diatonic - there are the same number of whole and half intervals, they're just distributed differently.

// major : 0,2,4,5,7,9,11,12

// minor : 0,2,3,5,7,8,10,12

Think of a super cool way to abstract this concept

#### Disclaimer

I am not trained in physics, and all the music theory I know I picked up in high school and never touched again.  This overview naturally reflects my understanding, not necessarily reality, and is just scratching the surface of both topics enough to write this program.  Please pipe up if I've said something here that's just not accurate.  That said, it did get us this far...

### Play The Sound

### Define Non-Random Inputs

//  the frequency in Hertz of a musical note with equal temperament: 440 * 2^(semitone distance / 12).
// 440 being A4

// inside a for loop (i = 0; i < 1; i += 0.0001)
// printf("%08X\n", 100*sin(1382*exp((a[$1 % 8]/12)*log(2))*i))

// this prints formatted 4-byte hex representing amplitute of the sound wave
// all is multiplied by 100 (scalar for volume control) - TODO structopt
// 1382 is ABOUT 440 * Pi - use RUST for this - constexpr??
// The bash verison uses 2^x = e^(x*ln(2)), we can just use 2^x
// 100 * sin((440*Pi) * (pick a random semitone / 12) * i)

// THEN instead of xxd, convert back into binary
// Use aplay to play actual sound - I bet there's a Pure Rust way to do this

// Minor scale
